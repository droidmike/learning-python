num1 = (input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = (input("Enter another number:"))
result = int(num1) + int(num2)  # the function int is for integers/whole numbers
print(result)

# the second part from line 6 is another program read it well
num3 = (input("Enter a number: "))
num4 = (input("Enter another number:"))
result = float(num3) + float(num4)  # the function float is for any number including decimals
print(result)

# and congratulations to me for making a basic calculator program
