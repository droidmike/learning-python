print(len(python))  # len is a function that checks the number of the characters in a string
print(python[0])  # checks what character is on that index/or number if u wish on that string
# remember indexes start from zero as seen from the line 28
print(python[3])  # another example
print(python.index("M"))  # this give a parameter and u r kinda asking what index character M is on that string
print(python.replace("Michael", "John"))
# the replace function as shown on line 33 replaces some word on a string with what you want
# ****practice and learn more functions

# learning how to work with numbers is next
